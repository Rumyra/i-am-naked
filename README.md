##I Am Naked

**I am Naked** is an HTML5 barebones Wordpress theme. This time with no CSS already written so you can create your very own. This theme concentrates on beautiful clean simple HTML5 markup - no extra divs & purely semantic elements.

This theme answers the need for better HTML in wordpress themes.

It was written because I seached for a long time and couldn't find a starting skeleton theme where I agreed with the mark up used.

I hope that you find it as useful as I do.

###To do

Sort out nav function to render <nav> element
